## Project Description

We have developed a SaaS web application, called Energy Live 2022, that allows users to monitor electricity market prices in Europe through their browser. The data, which is made available as open data, will be collected automatically by the application, through an API connection, and will be displayed on the website as a chart. Users must have a valid paid subscription to the application to be able to use it. 

## Supported Functions

* Selection of energy market quantity (Actual total load, Generation per type, Cross border flows), country and, if applicable, other parameters, as well as the starting date of the visualisation
* Display of the values of the quantity in a chart, starting from the selected date and ending at the current date, with the option to update the chart when new data are added
* Option to download the data in a CSV file, or download the chart image
* Sign in via the "Sign in with Google" service

## Tools

For the development of the application, we used the following tools:

* Design and architecture: **Visual Paradigm CE**

* Source code and agile project management: **GitHub**
